# Tactic

Tactic is a Self-Learning AI for playing Tic-Tac-Toe

Compile the .cpp file and run the newly created .exe file

Or simply run the existing .exe file

Then wait for a short time while two AI players play, 
each learning more with each loss

Once the 1st player (X) has attained 1800 wins, it is now the human 
player's turn to play for X against the AI player (O)

At which point, winning is not impossible for the human player, 
but extremely difficult
